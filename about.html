        <h3>What's a hackathon?</h3>
        <p>A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build &and; share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science.</p>

        <h3>Do you do travel reimbursements?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately we don't have the sponsorship to cover this :(</p>

        <h3>What can attend?</h3>
        <p>Any student currently enrolled on a university degree programme can attend. We also hope to allow senior high school students (16 - 17) but this isn't currently confirmed.</p>

        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>0, nothing, null, void. Royal Hackaway is free to attend with everything provided by our super sponsors!</p>

        <h3>What's the deal with food?</h3>
        <p>We'll provide you with food across the weekend free of charge. Please make sure you let us know of any dietry requirements.</p>

        <h3>Can I stay overnight?</h3>
        <p>You'll be able to work overnight in the venue. You might want to bring stuff like sleeping bags and we will have a relaxation area for you to crash out.</p>

        <h3>Who owns my project?</h3>
        <p>You and your team! We, and our sponsors, don't claim any rights to your IP - you are free to do as you wish with it. It would be cool if you put your code on an online repository, like <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> but you are under no obligation to do so.</p>

        <h3>Can I start before I arrive?</h3>
        <p>While you can explore ideas, you cannot write a line of code for your project before the event itself.</p>

        <h3>What shall I bring?</h3>
        <p>Bring your laptop, charger(s) and any other devices you wish to work on at the hackathon. If you are staying overnight, you will also need to bring toiletries, and a sleeping bag or blanket and pillow.</p>
