  The competition is being held in the Windsor Building and will start at 10:00 and finish at 16:00, with lunch provided by BAE Systems. They will be around all day to provide hints and tips on the challenges and are happy to discuss careers in cyber security and software engineering at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence. If you’re interested please send them an email and sign up!
  <br>
  This is a team-based challenge for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – come along anyway as teams will be created on the day.  The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic searches, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work.
